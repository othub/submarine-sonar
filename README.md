# Submarine Sonar

The main objective of the project is to be able to enjoy a simulation of a submarine sonar using Arduino and Processing.

The screen is a sonar composed of an angle of 180 degrees divided into 9 parts and arcs in which each arc is 5 cm away from the other.

It is done through the detection of objects and measuring distances between the Ultrasonic Distance Sensor SR04 and the object that approaches it emitting a sonar sound  and another of an alarm each time the distance is "dangerous" , in this case I use 4 cm.

In addition to the mentioned above, there is a message above the sonar that shows the distance of the closest object to the sensor.
